## User Stories
[Project Board](https://github.com/users/RadheyaM/projects/3/views/1) - for detailed user story progression and developer notes.

### Developer Vision

As a developer I want to design a site that is visusally attractive, with an intuitive interface leading to great overall user experience.  I want visitors to the site to like what they see and retain their attention.  It should be immediately clear how to navigate the site and find what you want.  The purpose of the site should be obvious, and clearly stated.  Colour should be used to indicate function, whether a button leads to information or performs a forward action.  Familiar navigation structures and layouts reduce the risk of frustrating visitors and provide comfort in intuitive action.

### Customer Stories

As a visitor to the site:

- I want to understand the purpose of the site so that I know if I can find what I'm looking for.
- I want to find out more about the site and products on offer by browsing around.
- I want to be able to browse through all the products to find what I'm looking for.
- I want to search or filter the products for a particular term to save time instead of scrolling.
- I want the listed products to have good images and descriptions so that there is no doubt as to the quality of the product or what it is.
- I want to see a summary of product details in the products page so that I don't need to click on every item to double check.
- I want to see clearly how much a product costs.
- I want to be able to find out more about a product by a detail page at a click.
- I want to be able to add an item to a wishlist so that I can come back later and find the item when ready to make a purchase.
- I want to be able to add an item to my basket and still be able to continue browsing.
- I want to be able to check what is in my basket without leaving the page I'm currently on.
- I want to be able to see the cumulative cost of my basket items.
- I want to know how much I need to spend to get free delivery.
- I want to know about deals or ways to save money such as codes or sign-up offers.
- I want to be able to remove items from my basket without deleting the whole basket.
- I want to be able to checkout securely, and be reasured that the checkout proceedure is secure.
- I want confirmation that my order has been processed successfully.
- I want to be able to find a history of my previous orders.
- I want to get in contact with site admin to ask a question or resolve an issue with the site or an order.
- I want to be able to review the site and let other users/owners know if my experience has been good or bad.
- If I like the site and products I want to recieve information on early deals, offers or new products in an email newsletter.
- I want to create an account to get the offer, or to use the wishlist functionality, or to see my previous orders or to save my address details.
- I want to be able to use my account and features, login and out, change my password, recover my password etc without encountering frustrating bugs or issues.
- When I perform an action on the site, such as add an item to my basket, I want clear and immediate feedback on my action so I don't have to double check.
