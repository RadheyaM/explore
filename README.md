## User Stories
Who, What, Where, When, Why.

### Developer Vision

As a developer I want to design a site that is visusally attractive, with an intuitive interface leading to great overall user experience.  I want visitors to the site to like what they see and retain their attention.  It should be immediately clear how to navigate the site and find what you want.  The purpose of the site should be obvious, and clearly stated.  Colour should be used to indicate function, whether a button leads to information or performs a forward action.  Familiar navigation structures and layouts reduce the risk of frustrating visitors and provide comfort in intuitive action.

### Customer Stories
